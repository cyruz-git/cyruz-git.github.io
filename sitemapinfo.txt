You may have noticed I’ve also introduced two new optional front-matter variables: updated and noindex. These can be used like so:

---
permalink: /contact/thankyou/
layout:    default
title:     Thank You
noindex:   true
---

Doing this will add /contact/thankyou/ to my “Disallow” list in robots.txt and remove it from sitemap.xml entirely.

---
layout:  post
title:   Hello World
updated: 2013-06-22
---

Doing this will change the lastmod timestamp of the post in sitemap.xml (and later we’ll use this in our rss/atom feed as well).
