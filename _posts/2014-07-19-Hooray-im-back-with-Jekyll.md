Finally my site is back online with a minimalistic layout, self hosted and static thanks to 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I spent some days to get fully involved in the Jekyll universe, but now I'm happy I've 
done it. Now I know something about static site generators and I already started to automate the publishing process 
with a ton of scripts.

Anyway I'm not a big writer. I did it in the past, as a reviewer, but normally I don't write too much for personal or 
technical thoughts. This time I hope I will have the chance to dedicate some posts to this blog, but please, don't 
blame my poor English.

So, take your time to visit the website and read the [colophon](/colophon/) for the technical information.
