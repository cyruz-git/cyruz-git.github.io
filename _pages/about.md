I'm a graduated *computer scientist* with a deep interest for anything IT-related. My preferences and skills range from 
**systems & networks** to **programming**, with a strong inclination for **scripting** and **automation**.

In the past I worked as a *teacher*, *reviewer*, *supply manager*, *network support engineer* and *IT consultant*, so 
my working experience is varied and substantial. Actually I work as **IT Officer** for 
[Costa Crociere S.p.A.](http://www.costacruise.com) onboard their fleet's ships.

Thanks to this job I have the opportunity to be in touch with many different languages and cultures, travelling around 
the world and visiting new places while improving my managerial skills.

Aside from my addiction to the Information and Communication Technologies I really enjoy watching and playing football 
(you know, I'm italian) and I'm fond of thoughtful movies, experimental music and old style videogames.
