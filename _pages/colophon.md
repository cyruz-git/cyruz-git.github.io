I created this site from the ground with the following tools and minimalism in mind:

{: class="dl-horizontal"}
Static Generator:
: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) as a reference site.

Markdown Parser:
: [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/), with GitHub Flavored Markdown enabled.

Tag Generator:
: <del>[Jekyll Tag Page Generator](https://github.com/danieldevries/jekyll-tag-generator) plugin.</del>After the 
  migration to GitHub I ditched the plugin for a static tag page. My old implementation is 
  [forked on GitHub](https://github.com/cyruz-git/jekyll-tag-generator).

Style:
: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for a consistent and minimal framework, with some customizations.

Fonts:
: [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) font for the Header, through the 
  [Google Fonts API](https://www.google.com/fonts).

Art:
: [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) on the [landing page]({{ "/" | relative_url }}).

Various Guides:

The site is <del>self hosted on a [Crissic Virtual Private Server](https://crissic.net/) using 
[nginx](http://nginx.org/) as a web server and pushed through [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/)</del> hosted on 
[GitHub](https://github.com) and pushed through [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) from Windows. The 
authoring is done on Windows with [notepad2-mod](http://xhmikosr.github.io/notepad2-mod/).
