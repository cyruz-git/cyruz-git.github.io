I created this site from the ground with the following tools and minimalism in mind:

{: class="dl-horizontal"}
Static Generator:
: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) as a reference site.

Markdown Parser:
: [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/), but the [redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) extensibility 
  is making me think...

Tag Generator:
: [Jekyll Tag Page Generator](https://github.com/danieldevries/jekyll-tag-generator) plugin.

Style:
: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for a consistent and minimal framework, with some customizations.

Fonts:
: [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) font for the Header, through the 
  [Google Fonts API](https://www.google.com/fonts).

Art:
: [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) on the [landing page]({{ site.baseurl }}).

Various Guides:
: [PixelCog](http://pixelcog.com)'s 
  [Jekyll From Scratch - Core Architecture](http://pixelcog.com/blog/2013/jekyll-from-scratch-core-architecture/)

The site is self hosted on a [Crissic Virtual Private Server](https://crissic.net/) using [nginx](http://nginx.org/) as
a web server and pushed through [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/) from Windows thanks to 
[DeltaCopy](http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp). The authoring is done on Windows with
